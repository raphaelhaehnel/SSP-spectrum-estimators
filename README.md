## PROJECT IN STATISTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING (SSP)

This project has been done during the course "SSP" with Prof. Sharon Gannot, Bar-Ilan University,
2023, second semester.

The aim of this project is to implement differents estimators to estimate spectrums.

The exercice deals with spectrum estimation of two signals: MA process and AR process.

The purpose of the exercice is to compare the estimation efficiency with different methods
