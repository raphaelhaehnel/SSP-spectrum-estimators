## PROJECT IN STATISTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING (SSP)

This project has been done during the course "SSP" with Prof. Sharon Gannot, Bar-Ilan University,
2023, second semester.

The aim of this project is to implement differents estimators to estimate spectrums and compare they efficiency

The exercice deals with spectrum estimation of two signals: MA process and AR process. We're dealing with 5 estimators:

1. Correlogram
2. Periodogram
3. Barlett
4. Welch
5. Blackman Tukey
